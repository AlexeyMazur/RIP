Statistics of Repeat-Induced Point mutations (RIP) can be analyzed by using partitioned RIP propensity (PRP) profiles.
The present directory contains a program and sample data for computing an example of a PRP profile.
Additional data and details concernging the algorithm can be found in the published article:
Alexey K. Mazur and Eugene Gladyshev "Partition of repeat-induced point mutations reveals structural aspects
 of homologous DNA-DNA pairing" (2018) Biophys. J., https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpj.2018.06.030.
